 ## 5th_project Medical X-ray Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network
 
 ## Objective/Goal
 To create a model by Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that can classify X-Ray images as Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia or Bacterial Pneumonia. 
 
 ## Role
 We worked independently for 1 month for our 5th team project to extract, clean, analyze, visualize, create model and fit the models.
 
 ## Data
 The dataset that we are going to use for the image classification is Chest X-Ray images, which consists of 4 categories,  Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia and     Bacterial Pneumonia.
 The data set is organised into 2 folders (train, test) 
 Total number of observations (images): 572
 Training observations: 532 (133 Normal cases, 133 Covid-19 cases, 133 Viral Pneumonia cases, 133 Bacterial Pneumonia cases)
 Testing observations: 40 (10 Normal cases, 10 Covid-19 cases, 10 Viral Pneumonia cases, 10 Bacterial Pneumonia cases)

 ## Results

 Image Augmentation expands the size of the dataset by creating a modified version of the existing training set images that helps to increase dataset variation and     ultimately improve the ability of the model to predict new images.
 
 We used to Optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN through GridSearch
 Conclusion: 
  
 Weâ€™ve created a CNN model that can classify X-Ray images as Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia and Bacterial Pneumonia  with an accuracy of over 75% on the test set and 92% on the training set.
